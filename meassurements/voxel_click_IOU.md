# Voxel click IOU

Effect of voxel size and click area on mean IOU in S3DIS dataset.

Meassured so far on `dataset/S3DIS_converted_downsampled_new_mini/test` having 10 point cloud files. 
With testing 5 click combinations for every object in scene it had 1300 unique input scenarios.

Meassured by `find_best_voxel_click.py` and visualized by `visualize_best_voxel_click.py`.

Best voxel click: Voxel_size = 0.07, Click area = 0.07.
